zLagBar v1.6 by DrunkDwarf (drunkdwarf@gmail.com)

-------------------Installation:---------------------

You need at least mIRC 6.01 to use this addon, and 
must not have any other addons that use tbwin.dll by
Dohcan as they may conflict

Extract all files to the same directory (you should 
put them under the mIRC directory, although it is not 
necessary)

Then in mIRC type /load -rs zlagbar.mrc , remember to 
specify a directory if you have put it anywhere other 
than the mirc directory, 
i.e /load -rs c:\mydir\zlagbar.mrc

If the "Script Warning" window appears, Click OK.

Once you've done that, you should notice the lagbar 
appear on your toolbar (there may be a slight delay)

Options can be found if you Right-Click on the Lagbar

-------------------Information:----------------------

To show your Current Lag (and your highest and lowest
recorded lag) type /lag in the active window

If you are using a Toolbar Background in mIRC, then 
the lagbar will use it as the background of the lagbar,
using the part of the background image it covers

You can change the Lagbar Foreground and Background
colours if you Right-Click on the lagbar and select
"Colour" , you can also select the Text colour.

You can choose between 3 different styles of LagBar,
a percent bar lagbar, a line graph one, and a bar graph one by 
Right-Clicking on the lagbar and selecting "Style"

You can change the Font and size of font used for the
text if you Right-Click on the lagbar and Select "Font"

You can change the Peak amount of seconds used for the
Lagbar by Right-Clicking on the lagbar and selecting 
"Peak"

You can change the lag checking method by Right-Clicking
on the Lagbar and selecting "Method" the 3 methods are
Pong, CTCP and Raw. if one does not work, try another.

You can change the Delay between checking the lag by
Right-Clicking on the lagbar and selecting "Delay"

If you wish to Unload the addon, you can Right-Click on
the lagbar and select "Unload LagBar" or use
/unload -rs zlagbar.mrc (include the directory if its
anywhere other than the mIRC directory)
